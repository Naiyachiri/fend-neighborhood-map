# FEND Neighborhood Map Project 8

## References

[Google Maps JS API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) : Used to generate the map, markers, and infowindows

[FourSquare API](https://foursquare.com/developers/apps) : Used to load the venue array

### TODO

BUG: The child applications need to be passed the filtered array or the index queried will show the wrong info window

FEAT: Markers need to bounce after being selected // deselected

STYLE: Make it look nicer
